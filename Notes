* Add Tx management to Frontend

* Add CRL state load to Frontend
    - Loading Tx state and loading object state from disk are key
    - May want to do this with a completion handler rather than force all objects to be loaded
      synchronously
    - Should be able to read all objects in parallel. Backend model must support that
      anyway.
        - simplifies impl approach


TODO

    ** Need to check size of augmented KV object as part of Tx Locking.


Backlog / Ideas
---------------

Could use alternative store mechanism for in-memory objects. Similar to CRL, we stream to
disk an operation log when content is updated in memory. Only when we purge the object
from cache do we write back the value to the owning store.
   |-> very similar to kernel file cache
   |-> we'll just journal it so we can recover the cache state on startup
