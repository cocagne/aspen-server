FD needs wrapper with drop() overridden to close the file handle. or stream can do it.

Rather than pointer-heavy approach, create a LocalUpdates struct with a single pointer and an 
array of (UUID, offset, length) values. They always arrive together and are used together. No
need to treat each individually. For writes, we can use the LocalUpdates structure as-is and
send the index to the object-specific entry


MSPC channels
    * Read threads to store could use sync channel but async is probably okay
        - Store can track how many outstanding operations it has and return overload if too many
    * Definitely track outstanding backend operations
        - use timestamps on ops for metrics purposes

KeyValue Objects
    * Can use pointers into the raw object buffer for KV pairs & metadata
    * Optional BTreeMap for sorted operations
