* Channel-based store manager 
    * Implemented as a thread
    * 2 channels
        - Network threads - registration, read requests, & tx
        - I/O threads for read/write

    ** Need to check size of augmented KV object as part of Tx Locking.


Backlog / Ideas
---------------

Could use alternative store mechanism for in-memory objects. Similar to CRL, we stream to
disk an operation log when content is updated in memory. Only when we purge the object
from cache do we write back the value to the owning store.
   |-> very similar to kernel file cache
   |-> we'll just journal it so we can recover the cache state on startup
