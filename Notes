1. Tx Requirements Error Checking
2. Key-Value object encode/decode
3. Channel-based store handler threade
    a. 2 channels, store backends and reader threads


Transaction handling
    - Only call Tx methods when all objects are loaded
    - Pass all objects in hashmap to Tx
    - Impl Tx stuff in Tx module, then tie into store Frontend

Start from single-threaded store part. Assume channel-based Request/Reply for store
backends.

Could use alternative store mechanism for in-memory objects. Similar to CRL, we stream to
disk an operation log when content is updated in memory. Only when we purge the object
from cache do we write back the value to the owning store.
   |-> very similar to kernel file cache
   |-> we'll just journal it so we can recover the cache state on startup
