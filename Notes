MSPC channels
    * Read threads to store could use sync channel but async is probably okay
        - Store can track how many outstanding operations it has and return overload if too many
    * Definitely track outstanding backend operations
        - use timestamps on ops for metrics purposes

KeyValue Objects
    * Can use pointers into the raw object buffer for KV pairs & metadata
    * Optional BTreeMap for sorted operations
